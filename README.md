# Art-Generation-using-Neural-Style-Transfer
I developed an Art Generation system using Neural Style Transfer. Neural Style Transfer is a technique that utilizes deep neural networks to blend the style of one image with the content of another image, resulting in visually striking and artistic outputs.

Neural Style Transfer Process:

Content Image: The content image serves as the base for the generated artwork. It contains the objects and structures that will be preserved in the final result.

Style Image: The style image defines the artistic style that will be transferred to the content image. It contains the textures, colors, and patterns that will influence the final appearance.

Neural Network Training: A pre-trained Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), such as VGG16 or VGG19, is used as the backbone. By passing the content and style images through the network, we extract features at different layers to capture content and style representations.

Loss Function: A loss function is defined to measure the difference between the generated image and the target style and content. It consists of a style loss, content loss, and total variation loss.

Optimization: Using an optimization algorithm, such as gradient descent, the generated image is iteratively updated to minimize the loss function. This process ensures that the content is preserved while incorporating the desired style.

Art Generation: After the optimization process, the final generated image exhibits the content of the content image in the style of the style image, resulting in a unique artistic output.
